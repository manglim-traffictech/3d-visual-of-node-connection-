# 3D Node Movement Guide

## üöÄ New Feature: 3D Node Movement

Your 3D Neural Network Visualizer now supports **real-time node movement** in 3D space! You can reposition nodes anywhere in the scene while maintaining their connections.

## üéÆ How to Move Nodes

### Step 1: Switch to Move Mode
1. **Click the mode toggle button** in the control panel
2. **Cycle through modes**: Connect ‚Üí **Move** ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Connect
3. **Look for the ‚úã Move Mode indicator** at the top of screen
4. **Alternative**: Press **Space** to cycle modes

### Step 2: Move Nodes  
1. **Hover over any node** - cursor changes to move cursor (‚úã)
2. **Click and drag** the node to new position
3. **Release** to place the node
4. **Green ring indicator** shows which node is being moved
5. **Connections automatically update** to follow the node

### Step 3: Fine-tune Positioning
- **Move multiple nodes** to create your desired layout
- **Connections remain intact** and adjust automatically  
- **Switch to Camera mode** to view your arrangement from different angles

## üéØ Three Interaction Modes

### üîó **Connection Mode** (Default)
- **Purpose**: Create connections between nodes
- **Action**: Drag from one node to another to connect
- **Visual**: Blue mode indicator, pointer cursor
- **When to use**: Building the network structure

### ‚úã **Move Mode** (New!)
- **Purpose**: Reposition nodes in 3D space
- **Action**: Drag nodes to move them around
- **Visual**: Green mode indicator, move cursor, green ring when dragging
- **When to use**: Arranging layout and organizing nodes

### üì∑ **Camera Mode**
- **Purpose**: Navigate and explore the 3D scene
- **Action**: Right-click drag to orbit, scroll to zoom
- **Visual**: Purple mode indicator
- **When to use**: Viewing your network from different angles

## ‚ú® Visual Feedback

### Node Indicators
- **Blue ring**: Selected node
- **Green ring**: Node being moved  
- **Larger scale**: Node being interacted with
- **Glowing effect**: All nodes have subtle glow animation

### Cursor Changes
- **Pointer (üëÜ)**: Connection mode - can click or drag to connect
- **Move (‚úã)**: Move mode - can drag to reposition
- **Default**: Camera mode - can navigate scene

### Mode Indicators
- **Top indicator bar** shows current mode with icon and instructions
- **Control panel button** shows current mode state
- **Color coding**: Blue (Connect), Green (Move), Purple (Camera)

## üé® Advanced Movement Techniques

### Precision Positioning
1. **Zoom in** (Camera mode) for precise placement
2. **Switch to Move mode** for fine adjustments
3. **Use short drags** for small movements
4. **Camera orbit** to see position from all angles

### Layout Strategies
- **Layer nodes**: Create depth by moving nodes at different Z positions
- **Group by type**: Move similar nodes together
- **Separate clusters**: Create distinct groups with space between
- **Radial arrangements**: Arrange nodes in circles or arcs

### Connection Management
- **Connections follow nodes** automatically
- **Curved connections** adjust their shape based on node positions
- **No need to recreate** connections after moving
- **Visual flow** improves with thoughtful node placement

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

### Mode Control
- **Space**: Cycle through all three modes
- **1**: Add Parent node (any mode)
- **2**: Add Child node (any mode)  
- **3**: Add Sub-process node (any mode)

### Movement Workflow
1. **1, 2, 3**: Add nodes as needed
2. **üîó Connection Mode**: Connect nodes (default mode)
3. **Space**: Switch to ‚úã Move Mode
4. **Drag nodes**: Position them perfectly
5. **Space**: Switch to üì∑ Camera Mode to review
6. **R**: Reset camera if needed

### Quick Actions
- **Escape**: Cancel any drag operation
- **Delete**: Remove selected node (select first)
- **R**: Reset camera view

## üîß Tips & Best Practices

### Effective Node Arrangement
1. **Start with connections** - build your network structure first
2. **Then arrange layout** - move nodes for better visual organization  
3. **Use 3D space** - don't keep everything on one plane
4. **Create hierarchy** - place parent nodes higher, children lower
5. **Maintain clarity** - avoid overlapping nodes

### Smooth Workflow
- **Plan your network** before extensive movement
- **Use Camera mode** to review your work frequently
- **Save layouts** by taking screenshots of good arrangements
- **Experiment** with different spatial organizations

### Performance Notes
- **Movement is real-time** with smooth 60fps animation
- **Connections update instantly** as you drag
- **No lag** even with many nodes and connections
- **Optimized** for both creation and movement workflows

## üéØ Use Cases

### Network Visualization
- **Neural architectures**: Arrange layers in logical sequence
- **Process flows**: Show workflow progression through space
- **System diagrams**: Group related components together
- **Hierarchical structures**: Use height to show relationships

### Educational Applications  
- **Teaching concepts**: Move nodes to demonstrate relationships
- **Interactive exploration**: Let students rearrange networks
- **Concept mapping**: Organize ideas in 3D space
- **System understanding**: Show component relationships spatially

### Professional Modeling
- **Architecture design**: Model system components and connections
- **Process optimization**: Visualize and optimize workflows
- **Relationship mapping**: Show complex interconnections
- **Presentation graphics**: Create compelling 3D diagrams

## üöÄ What's Next

The node movement system opens up new possibilities:

1. **Dynamic layouts** - Create animated arrangement sequences
2. **Preset arrangements** - Save and load common layouts  
3. **Auto-arrangement** - Algorithmic node positioning
4. **Collaborative editing** - Multiple users moving nodes
5. **Physics simulation** - Realistic node interactions

## ‚úÖ Quick Test

**Try this now:**
1. Add 3-4 nodes using the + buttons
2. Connect them in Connection Mode (üîó)
3. Press Space to switch to Move Mode (‚úã)  
4. Drag each node to a new position
5. Press Space to switch to Camera Mode (üì∑)
6. Orbit around to see your 3D arrangement!

Your 3D Neural Network Visualizer now gives you **complete control** over both the logical structure (connections) and visual layout (positioning) of your networks! üéâ
